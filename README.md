# Terrain generation in OpenGL(3.3)
This project is about generation a heightmap-based terrain, in OpenGL 3.3 (C++). It's basically draws the surface with triangle strips, using a vertex buffer, and also an index buffer.

###I have used the following libraries:
* [**glfw**](http://www.glfw.org/) (creating windows with OpenGL contexts and receiving input and events)
* [**glew**](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) (extension loading library)
* [**SOIL**](http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html) (reading the input image)
* [**glm**](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html) (mathematics library)
